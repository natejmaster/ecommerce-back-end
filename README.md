# E-Commerce Back End
    
## Description
E-commerce sites often have such a large inventory and in such a wide variety that it often takes an electronic database to keep track of everything. This E-commerce back end is a small sample size of what much larger e-commerce sites do to add, remove, organize, and sort the various items they sell.

In the study of back end development, it is crucial for aspiring developers to have a good idea of how to manipulate the back end of these larger databases as this type of technology is paramount in entering any sort of digital marketplace. This was good practice for a very practical element of web development that can be used in a wide variety of mediums.
